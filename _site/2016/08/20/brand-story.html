<p>We see behind the surface, beyond obvious daily routines. We see the grand theatrical work of humanity as well as the trappings backstage; a system that supports billions of people as they live, work and play.</p>

<p>We see an incredibly complex and interconnected system of systems where buildings, and the spaces between them form communities, neighbourhoods and cities. These systems are alive: they grow and evolve and decay and die. They are a reflection of the lives and times that they make possible.</p>

<p>We believe it is our role to improve these systems, to be catalysts that make life better for ourselves, and the generations that follow.</p>

<h2 style="padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 20px; line-height: 1.2em">Designing the SALA System</h2>

<p>To accomplish this work we’ve designed a system called SALA, the School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of British Columbia.</p>

<p>At SALA we use a language called Architecture, where buildings and landscapes and the infrastructures that connect them are the nouns and the verbs. Nouns and verbs influence each other in sentences, which combine to create paragraphs, which in turn connect to create stories. These stories are the systems that make life work: we strive every day at SALA to inspire and write better stories than the ones that came before.</p>

<p>We very selectively seek out, engage and support the best and the brightest minds. Those who are curious critical thinkers.  We invite them here to live and engage with the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the real-world laboratory that SALA calls home.</p>

<p>We ask them to form the grand questions that need asking. Then we encourage them to find and share the best answers too.</p>

<p>We inculcate and inspire the next generation of practitioners, and we revel in constantly learning. We are all students, and always will be.</p>

<p>We curate connections between our own work and the work of others, to augment and broaden our positive impact on the world.</p>

<p>And we believe systems, including our own here at SALA, are best when constantly questioned. To that end we promote a culture of freedom; where innovation can take root, and where the curious can explore.</p>

<p>We carefully balance exclusivity and diversity. We want only the best and the brightest to walk the road with us, but we honour experience and knowledge of all kinds.</p>

<p>We are ambitious.</p>

<p>We know we can make the world a better place.</p>

<p>We know we can’t think of ourselves as architects or landscape architects or planners or designers at all. These words describe languages, just various means’ to an end.</p>

<p>In fact, we know to accomplish our ambitions for a better world we must be better than a school of architecture.</p>

<p>We must be architects of change.</p>
