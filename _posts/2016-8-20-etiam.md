<h2>Here are four essential tactics to make this brand work.</h2>


Perhaps each needs a champion within the organization?


1. Using the name of the organization consistently every time it is written or spoken aloud. 

2. Leveraging the wealth of stories we could be sharing that bolster our brand: our people, past and present who are doing/have done interesting things in pursuit of improving connectivities. Everyone loves stories about people; very few love stories about institutions. 

3. Improve social media outreach and strategies, and rethink the website based on the new brand framework to push our unique positioning to the fore.

4. Increasing connectivities: between citizens of the school, between the school and the community, and between the institution and funders. All are connected, and all are craving more.
