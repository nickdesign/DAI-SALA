<h2>Fact 1: Who We Are</h2>
<h3>A description that make sense to outside stakeholders:</h3>

We are SALA, but we think of ourselves as The School of Connectivities. We study how all human and built-form systems interact, and propose new ways to use architecture, landscape architecture, and other design-systems to make the world a better place.

---

<h2>Fact 2: Our Target</h2>
<h3>The broadest definition:</h3>

We seek practical connections to students, staff, faculty, potential recruits, and the communities we study and serve. But as The School of Connectivities, we are also more broadly interested in connecting to anyone who is interested in connecting with us.

---

<h2>Fact 3: Point of Reference</h2>
<h3>How we want to be seen by outside stakeholders:</h3>

SALA is small but intensely connected to all things. We explore our world, and use the language of architecture and landscape architecture to find better ways for all of us to live.

---

<h2>Fact 4: Point of Difference</h2>
<h3>What is the core theme that makes us unique:</h3>

We are intensely interested in connectivities amongst all people, all things, all systems, and all fields of inquiry. This creates and requires a culture that is integrated, collaborative, and diverse.

---

<h2>Fact 5: Reasons to Believe</h2>
<h3>What’s the proof?</h3>

We have work to do here. We know there is proof but we haven’t done a very good job of telling our truths. With this new brand framework we have a WAY to talk about our people and history, and leverage each to boost brand awareness.
