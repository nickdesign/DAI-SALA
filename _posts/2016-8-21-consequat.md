SALA is an always-evolving team of collaborators who use architecture and landscape architecture as a language to understand the complex systems that make the world. We are more than a school: we are, we create, and we catalyze critical thinkers who explore ideas that will have an impact. We are driven by a shared desire to design solutions that make the world a better place. The best and brightest minds aspire to be part of what we do. Other schools are envious of the innovation and freedom we enjoy.
