The School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of British Columbia stands alone. A small, intense and diverse group of faculty, students and staff who collaborate and support each otherâ€™s unique interests and areas of inquiry.  We believe that all people, places, spaces, and things can be made better by recognizing and honouring the interrelatedness and interdependence of all things: the connectivities.  

We revel in the diversity of thoughts, backgrounds and experiences that make up our community, and see parallels with the diversity of the living laboratory in which we are situated. 

We are a small hardworking team of diverse talents, working to find innovate ways to evolve and improve the places and spaces where we all live, work, and play.
