There is confusion about what SALA stands for, and as a result, expectations from both inside and outside stakeholder groups vary wildly. SALA is either amazing or terrible, doing a great job or doing a bad job. The lack of a story means everyone is creating their own benchmark, and measuring against it. 

SALA has many challenges when compared to similar institutions. The opportunity is to create our own comparative set, and define a new space. Let others fight over rankings and size and advanced equipment which will all-too-soon be obsolete. Let’s create our own playing field, and dominate it. 

It’s crucial to agree that we are not here to brand the profession or the practice or the discipline. We are here to brand a school. These objectives are easily confused. 

And finally, the debate around practical training vs. conceptual thinking is best left to other venues, other initiatives. Our stakeholders told us they want it all: our best response is to be who we are as best we can. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Let’s define a brand for The School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at the University of British Columbia that stands alone, as a new kind of flower in the field, unlike all the others.
