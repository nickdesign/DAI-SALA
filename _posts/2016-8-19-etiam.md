<h2>Here are five essential tactics to make this brand work</h2>


Perhaps each needs a champion within the organization?


1. Using the name of the organization consistently every time it is written or spoken aloud. 


2. Leveraging the wealth of stories we could be sharing that bolster our brand: our people, past and present who have made the world a better place. 
Everyone loves stories about people; very few love stories about institutions. 


3. Improve social media outreach and strategies, and rethink the website based on the new brand framework to push our unique positioning to the fore.


4. Increasing connectivities: between citizens of the school, between the school and the community, and between the institution and funders. All are connected, and all are craving more. 

5. And finally, the debate around practical training vs. conceptual thinking is best left to other venues, other initiatives. Our stakeholders told us they want it all: our best response is to be who we are as best we can be.
