            <h2>Six Factors of Contagion</h2>
            <p>Stories with more of these factors will be passed around.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Currency</strong>: How does talking about this brand infer insider status on the storyteller?</p>
            <p>Our profession is seen as an academic pursuit and perhaps disconnected from everyday life. Talking about SALA/UBC as an <em>entrepreneurial collaborative in a living laboratory</em> makes the potential for meaningful impact more tangible.</p>
            <p><strong>Triggers</strong>: How can you grow the habitat for your story and make it come to mind more often?</p>
            <p>Consistent use of the name of the organization in all ways and at all times.</p>
            <p>Social media swat team posting pics with #SalaGrad, a tag meant to identify the work of SALA grads, or problems that SALA grads might be able to contribute to, or any number of other connections. The point is to have that tag appear, in as many contexts as possible.</p>
            <p>Media outreach around expanded definitions of the scope of the profession, and of the role SALA plays, to encourage media to call on SALA faculty for expert commentary.</p>
            <p><strong>Emotion</strong>: How can you elicit joy not contentment, anger not annoyance? </p>
            <p>Leveraging the wealth of stories that bolster our brand: our people - past and present. Who is the “impact archivist”? Everyone loves stories about people; very few love stories about institutions.</p>
            <p>Are there emotional issues we could embroil ourselves in purposefully?</p>
            <p><strong>Public</strong>: How can the institution advertise itself?</p>
            <p>Open call for new building concept designs
            like the Dutch: can we raise money for self-funded civic projects that the city would otherwise not even consider?</p>
            <p>A new graphic identity and huge retail push: how can we make SALA badging desirable? Could SALA students design retailable solutions: what’s the book bag of 2017? What’s the best bike lock? Do we use Kickstarter to actually produce a SALA branded object once a year?</p>
            <p>Significant effort around social media engagement: can we team up with broadcast journalism/video students to produce online assets?</p>
            <p><strong>Practical Value</strong>: How can the story help the storyteller help others?</p>
            <p>Do we have an open call for problems that need SALA solutions each year, and assign teams? Telling the world about this free design service would have immense practical value and the added bonus of being public.</p>
            <p>Perhaps being invited to submit a situation and/or sit on the selection panel is a highly-regarded and sought-after appointment? See how Singularity University and IDEO are using engagement as a brand-building tool.</p>
            <p><strong>Trojan Horse</strong>: How can your brand story slide into the conversation more often?</p>
            <p>The more we can reinforce practical solutions to problems, solutions that have some connection to SALA either through ideas or individuals, the less academic and removed from reality the school will feel.</p>
            <p>All university departments are seen, with few outliers, as being detached from reality and locked in an ivory tower. SALA, by virtue of its connectivity to the profession and “real-world living laboratory” location, should have countless examples of real impact on real life. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Tell these stories.</span></p>
